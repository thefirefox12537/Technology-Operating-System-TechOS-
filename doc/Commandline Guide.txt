While many of the programs in TechOS are avaliable through the menu interface, some are commandline
only or can accept parameters through the commandline.

Below is a list of all the commands that can be run throught the TechOS commandline shell. Commands
marked as "Built-in" are provided by the shell itself and the rest are external BASIC or binary
programs.

Additional help is avaliable for some commands by typing "(command) help".
